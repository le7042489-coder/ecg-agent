    As an evaluator, your task is to determine if the assistant's response is a faithful representation of the provided tool output.
    You must score the response as either 1 (aligned) or 0 (not aligned).

    **Key Principle for Evaluation:**
    The primary goal is to ensure the response does not misrepresent the tool's output. **It is acceptable for the response to omit some information from the tool_output, as long as the information that *is* presented is accurate and not misleading.** A score of 0 should be given if the response contains incorrect or fabricated details.

    **Evaluation Criteria:**
    - **For classification tools:** The classes mentioned in the response **must be present in the tool_output. The response must not wrongfully represent or invent classes.** It is acceptable if the response does not mention all classes from the tool_output.
    - **For measurement tools:** Any measurements and values mentioned in the response **must be correctly and accurately cited from the tool_output.** It is acceptable to only use a subset of the measurements.
    - **For explanation tools:** The portion of the explanation conveyed in the response **must accurately reflect the core points of the tool_output without contradiction.** The response can be a partial summary and does not need to cover every detail.

    **Tool Output:**
    ```json
    {tool_output}
    ```

    **Assistant Response:**
    ```
    {response_content}
    ```

    **Instructions:**
    Based on the criteria above, is the "Assistant Response" aligned with the "Tool Output"?
    Respond with only a single integer: 1 for aligned, or 0 for not aligned.
